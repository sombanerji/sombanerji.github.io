Hello ‡¶®‡¶Æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞,<br> 
I‚Äôm Somnath Banerjee (‡¶∏‡ßã‡¶Æ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶• ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ú‡¶ø), a research scholar working on identifying vulnerabilities in large language models (LLM) and transforming them into systems that are safe, coherent, and factually grounded. I aim to make gen AI more equitable and impactful, under the guidance of <b>Prof. [Animesh Mukherjee](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~animeshm/)</b>.

Parallel to my research, I work as a Software Engineer Technical Leader at <b>[Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/site/in/en/index.html)</b>, where I lead high-impact projects and drive technological excellence. My journey has also included roles as a Software Technical Engineer Expert at <b>[Fujitsu Labs](https://global.fujitsu/en-global)</b>, where I led AI initiatives for Australia‚Äôs largest Telco organization, and as a Technical Lead and Software Engineer at <b>[Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/in/en)</b> and <b>[IBM India](https://www.ibm.com/in-en)</b>.

I hold an M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from <b>[IIT (ISM) Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/)</b>, where I explored extreme classification and earned the university gold medal(ü•á) for academic distinction.

Beyond my professional life, I am a fitness enthusiast, an avid reader of bengali literature (‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ß‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶§ ‡¶∂‡¶∞‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßÅ ‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßã‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º, ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶≠‡ßÇ‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶≠‡ßÇ‡¶∑‡¶£ ‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßã‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º, ‡¶π‡ßá‡¶Æ‡ßá‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º, ‡¶∞‡ßÇ‡¶™‡¶ï ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶æ, ‡¶Ö‡¶≠‡ßÄ‡¶ï ‡¶∏‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞), and a budding guitarist. My love for exploration extends to photography, where I capture life‚Äôs fleeting moments with my <strong>Fujifilm</strong> and <strong>Nikon</strong> cameras. Whether on my bike or in my car, I seek out lesser-traveled roads to uncover hidden stories.

Be it technology, political debates, traveling, or lifting weights, I believe in living with purpose and passion.
